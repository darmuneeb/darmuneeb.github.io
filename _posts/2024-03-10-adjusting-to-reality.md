Reality is ugly, boring and mundane. It is mondays and fridays and weekdays and weekends. In the formative years of an individual society engages one in simulations of reality.  In school one is sheltered from the ugliness of the world. Then college where reality is accounted for but in a very distorted form. Then we are thrown into work where the rough edges are smoothened by a formal jargon and scheduled outbursts of joy . All this to shelter us from the  fundamental reality. The pangs of which are felt on a usual Sunday evening. The longer one is prevented from the thought the longer one strays away from it. Trapped in a maze of desires that are programmed into us. But what is the fundamental reality. It is the bitter truth of the world. The ugliness of it. This world is a prison. We came here not from will and will leave as such. Things happen to us more than we make them happen. There is limited agency an individual has. Truth is that the freedom of individual is insatiable and the system can only allow so little of it. 

We may have decorated our world view but it’s only matter of time before the house of cards falls.

The sooner you adjust to that truth sooner you can account for it. Make genuine bonds without being deluded. Make peace with the fact that this world is designed to hurt you, test you, put you down. And anytime you feel good-any odd morning when the sun shines and you feel great be grateful for that.
