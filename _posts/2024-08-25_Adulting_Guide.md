1. Don’t be a bitch. Don’t cry foul. Play as others play...
2. Shed aside your victim mentality. You don’t have it as worse as you make it and life is not a bed of roses for anyone.
3. Be kind to yourself for the mistakes in your past whether they were done by you or to you. Make peace with the fact that the shit gets thrown your way. If some shit sticks wash it and move on. Don’t carry shit with you so you stink all the fine places you are destined to go later in life. In a sense this is a test of your will and resilience to not be defined by what happened but by what ought to happen.
4. Be kind to people they are like you. In your teenage high you might have been deluded into thinking that you are special. well in some aspects it maybe true but insofar as human emotions, desires, motivations or our humanness in general are considered we are same. That doesn’t mean be a person with no boundaries but just be genuine and all your cleverness, well pour it into solving problems. This thought doesn't just unburden you of the conflicts that arise because of this thinking but it has a hidden upside. It makes dealing with people a lot easier. You become more empathetic or to quote Gatsby you can better fit into the shoes of the other people.
5. Don’t be a pushover. Stand for what you believe is right. In your nihilistic vision it maybe pointless to stand for anything but in a grand scheme of world your philosophy doesn’t count for shit. Things happen anyways. With whatever limited agency you have take a stand on things you think will improve some aspect of your community or world. At least stand for something.
6. In matters of money, career and profession do your work diligently and don’t try to hack your way up. Think of money as a token of social credit. The more you work on something that people value more you earn that credit and use it to create the life you aspire to live. This may not be the popular opinion where everyone tries to hack accumulation of money but this is a no bullshit path where you will have most peace of mind. Don't settle for something less by being complacent. Just put in the hard work. Money tastes sweeter that way.
