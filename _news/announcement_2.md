Announcements and news can be much longer than just quick inline posts. In fact, they can have all the features available for the standard blog posts. See below.

I received the offer letter and I will be joining on 6th Oct after talking to the HR to change my joining date from 4th. I am planning on resigning on 5th from xion. There are few problems I am having with this transition. Eg Given the current job I have this upgrade is all going too well, you know far too well to be true. It is kind of FOMO from my current job. What if I don't like it there. So the uncertainty is kind of pushing my buttons. I have talked to guys at fareye and they seem to like working there so far. Another one problem is regarding the laptop they will be sending. The shithole I am currently living in( sorry I sound like an ungrateful Pip from Great Expectations) has no courier delivery services. I think I will give the address of my friend in Srinagar to collect it and work out the details with the HR. Yeah I hope this all goes well. It is a totally new territory for me so I am not in control which sucks for me because I have realised I am kind of a control freak.
