I have always been interested and fascinated by academia. It is borderline romantic connection fuelled by the Hollywood and Bollywood imaginations. 
In my college days I have been a teaching assistant for a course “numerical methods and computer programming in c++”. I have worked as an online tutor for +2 level physics. 
I intend to fuel my passion for academia by continuing  teaching practice. 
Adding this space to track the progression in that field.
