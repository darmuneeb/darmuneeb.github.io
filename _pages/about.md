Hi There, thanks for dropping by. Quick Intro...I am an aspiring public servant. Having graduated from IIT Roorkee in Civil Engineering I worked as a software developer for a while before making transition into the much aspired-for field of public administration. 
I am an avid reader, curious about range of topics from computers to philosophy. My motto is 'collective salvation through individual freedom'
I write occasionally and you can jump to the [blog](/_pages/blog.md/) section to check some of my recent ramblings.
