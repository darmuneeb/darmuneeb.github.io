I am an aspiring public servant. I graduated from IIT Roorkee in Civil Engineering. Then I worked as a software developer for a while before making transition into the much aspired-for field of public administration. 
I am an avid reader, curious about range of topics from computers to philosophy. My motto is 'collective salvation through individual freedom'
